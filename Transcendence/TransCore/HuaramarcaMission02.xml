			<Text id="Name">
				"Huaramarca Dream Test"
			</Text>
			<Text id="Summary">
			</Text>
			<Text id="Intro1">

				The doors to the Grand Hall open and a short man approaches you.

				"Welcome, friend, my name is Apotamo. You have journeyed long 
				and rested little. I fear I offer only more of the same."

			</Text>
			<Text id="Intro2">

				"After the Sung stole our worlds and after we retreated to our 
				refuge,	the High Priest of this temple prophesied that all we 
				had lost we would one day regain.
				
				"One day, he said, a %man% will appear and %he% will lead
				us to redemption in the realm of the Light.

				"And now, when almost all hope is lost, here you are."

			</Text>
			<Text id="Intro3">

				"The Sung have discovered our last refuge, and even now they 
				seek to exterminate us. Is it possible you and your lonely ship 
				have been called to deliver us?

				"There is one way to find out."

			</Text>
			<Text id="Intro4">

				"The Light speaks to us all. And if we don't always hear Him, 
				it's only because our minds are so busy talking."

				Apotamo touches your shoulder and you feel a sharp pain. You see
				a small needle in his hand.

				"Don't worry, you will not be harmed. Listen to what the Light 
				has to say to you."

			</Text>
			<Text id="Intro5">

				The temple walls glow and shift with amazing colors and you hear
				a distant music so beautiful that you fall to your knees in 
				gratitude. A profound peace envelops you and your consciousness 
				fades into a pinhole of light.

				Slowly you wake up and find yourself beneath the wide open skies
				of a beautiful planet.
				
				Though you have never been to Earth you recognize it 
				immediately.

			</Text>
			<Text id="AcceptReply">
				{	
					textID: 'textAcceptReply
					labelID: 'actionContinue
					}
			</Text>
			<Text id="textAcceptReply">
			
				You wake and find yourself on the floor of the Huari temple.
				Apotamo looks down at you, a concerned look on his face.

				"I'm sorry I had to put you through that, but I had to know. You
				are not the Solti. Your worries are about this world, not the 
				realm of the Light.

				"But the Light did speak to you, did He not? Perhaps your 
				destiny is still intertwined with ours."

			</Text>
			<Text id="SuccessMsg"></Text>

			<Text id="dreamStart">

				You are in a mountain valley beneath bright blue skies. A path
				in front of you climbs up the mountain face. Behind you a river
				flows along the valley floor.

			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamCaveMouth">

				You are on a steep path climbing up the mountain. To your right
				you see the mouth of a dark cave.

			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamRuinsGate">

				The mountain path levels out to a small plateau. To the left you
				see a stone archway leading to ancient ruins. In front of you
				the path continues to the peak.

			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamPeak">

				Lightheaded and winded, you reach the peak. From here you see a
				small village far below, nestled in the valley floor. As you
				watch, an army of bandits appears and rides towards the
				defenseless village.

			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamRuins">

				You are inside ancient stone ruins. A stone building is in front
				of you. To the right you see stairs leading into darkness.

			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamAltar">

				Inside the building you see a tall, robed man standing before a
				bound girl lying on a stone altar. The man holds up a golden
				knife and exclaims:
				
				"God of the Sun, deliver us from the evil that threatens our 
				village!"

			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamCatacombs">

				You are inside a burial chamber for great war heroes. All are
				dressed in their finest armor. All are forgotten by the	living.
				One of the faces looks familiar.
				
				He turns to you and says, "Your turn!"

			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamT1">

				You are in a damp and narrow cavern. A path leads to the left;
				another leads to the right.

			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamT2">

				You are in great chamber of quartz. A path leads to the left;
				another leads to the right.

			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamT3">

				You are in a damp cavern dimly lit by glowing lichen. A path
				leads to the left; another leads to the right.

			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamT4">

				You are in a wide cavern filled with stalactites. A path leads
				to the left; another leads to the right.

			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamT5">

				You are in a small chamber with a cold and clear pool. A path
				leads to the left; another leads to the right.

			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamPrecipice">

				You stand before a deep pit. Inside you see the decomposed 
				remains	of hundreds of villagers. As you turn away, the ground 
				gives way and you fall into the pit.

			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamLair">

				You smell a foul stench and hear a deep growl.

				A roar startles you and pain grabs you as steel claws rip your
				flesh. The last thing you see is the glowing maw of a titanic
				dragon.

			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamVillage">

				The river path comes to a small village. The villagers ignore 
				you	as they hurriedly barricade their doors and close their 
				windows.

				There is a temple in the center of the village. To the right a
				path leads to a fortress on a hill.

			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamTemple">

				You enter a stone temple. A door to the left leads to the 
				Chamber	of the Moon; the one to the right leads to the Chamber 
				of the Sun.

			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamMoonRoom">

				You are in a dark and silent chamber. Moonlight pours in through
				a window and illuminates the figure of a priest. The priest is 
				covered in blood and clutching a wooden shield tightly.
				
				He stares at you and says, "They need your help."

			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamSunRoom">

				You are in a bright chamber. Sunlight pours in through a window
				and illuminates the figure of a priest. The priest is covered in
				blood and wielding a metal sword.
				
				He hands you the sword says, "I left some for you!"

			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamFortress">

				You enter the fortress; there are barracks in front of you. 
				Behind you there is a look-out tower.

			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamBarracks">

				The barracks are filled with soldiers sharpening their swords. 
				One of them turns to you and says:
				
				"Where's your sword, pilgrim? Did you leave it in the temple?"
				
				The rest of the men laugh uproariously.

			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamTower">

				You climb the tower. Out the window you see an army of bandits
				riding towards the village. The lead bandit sees you and yells:

				"You'll be the last to die, pilgrim, but the first to suffer!"
