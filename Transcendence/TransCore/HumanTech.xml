		<!-- Ship Standard

			This element defines standard constants for calculating various 
			ship defaults, such as hull price. For example, we define the 
			standard power consumed by a drive as 2 MW. Ship that consume more
			than that cost less.

			Vault of the Galaxy has completely different defaults, to reflect
			a different scale.
