				Huygens Explorer\n
				Captain's Log
			</Text>
			<Text id="textLog1">

				The signal that we were tracking led us to an interesting discovery:
				the wreck of an Iocrym sentinel with an intact AI core. It must have
				been destroyed in a battle because we found several Luminous drone
				wrecks nearby.

				We've taken the sentinel's AI core onboard in hopes that it will 
				help us to understand the Iocrym and what they are doing.

				We've deployed a log buoy marking this location and attached the
				coordinates of our next destination.

			</Text>
			<Text id="textLog2">

				In studying the sentinel's AI core we have learned a lot more about
				the Iocrym. They are an ancient race bred to be guardians and
				defenders. Their role is to protect other civilizations from
				(unspecified) threats originating at the periphery of the galactic
				disk. Is it possible that they consider us to be a threat? It seems
				hard to believe considering how advanced their technology is.

				Chief Scientist Masud is eager to learn more from the AI. We have
				decided to connect it to the Huygens' mainframe in order analyze the
				information more quickly. Of course we have followed the standard
				quarantine procedures to ensure the AI cannot compromise our systems.

			</Text>
			<Text id="textLog3">

				In the last few days we have learned much from the sentinel's AI.
				Masud has made progress interpreting some of the Iocrym symbols and
				language. Much of the information that we're finding is actually
				about us (human beings, that is). It seems they are as curious about
				us as we are about them. More than curious, actually. They are almost
				obsessed; they are frantic to learn quickly, which is unnerving for
				an ancient race used to dealing in eons.

				The only problem we have to report is a fault in our communications
				array. The Huygens' mainframe indicates that we will be unable to
				send or receive for the next seven hours, but the outage will not
				affect our investigations.

			</Text>
			<Text id="textLog4">

				The sentinel's AI has shut down for unknown reasons. We have tried
				several times to re-establish a connection but to no avail. Masud
				is puzzled and he has begun an analysis of all data traffic between
				our mainframe and the AI.

				More worrying to us is a newly discovered fault in our main drive.
				The Huygens' mainframe believes the drive is damaged, but that it
				can be repaired. The onboard nanofacs are creating the necessary
				parts under computer control.

				Computer checksums and diagnostics reveal no mainframe problems;
				other manual checks show that the mainframe is correct in its
				diagnosis and repairs of the main drive. Nevertheless, the crew is
				uneasy, particularly since communications is still inoperative.

			</Text>
			<Text id="textLog5">

				The sentinel's AI has control of the ship! It must have exploited a
				vulnerability in the mainframe kernel or perhaps gained physical
				access to the databanks. We don't even know when the AI gained
				control...it could have happened the second we connected. We are
				going to try to disable the main drive, but if everything else fails
				we will attempt to overload the reactor.

				We have attached tracking signatures to this buoy that will lead to
				our current location. Whoever finds this log, please come and help us!
