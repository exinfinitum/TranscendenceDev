				You enter the Main Hall and see a young man wearing a heavy 
				backpack. He stops to introduce himself.

				You enter the station with Solomon at your side. He leads the
				way holding a small blaster in his hands.

				Together you search the station, but find only debris and a few
				shell-shocked outlaws.

				You find what looks like an infirmary. Displays and holopanes
				line the walls, and in the center you see three open capsule
				beds, large enough to fit a person.

				Solomon frowns. "Oh, gods! No!"

				Solomon sits on the ground, breathing hard.

				Solomon stands up and activates one of the displays. He starts
				scrolling through several pages of information.

				"The Sung Slavers don't kill their captives. They keep them in
				the coffins and use them for processing power. My sister is 
				still alive somewhere.

				"I just need to find where."

				Solomon turns to you.

				"They track everything in this database. I should be able to

				you got me this far. I can take it from here."
