			<Text id="Name">Teraton Research</Text>
			<Text id="Briefing">
				You enter a dim cavern filled with arcane equipment. Dozens of
				human subjects, wired, tubed, and in various stages of health
				and wholeness, lie on articulated beds.

				A tall Teraton with supernumerary fingers approaches you.
				"Human! You desire to join the research? You will be compensated
				with gifts from beyond."
			</Text>
			<String id="AcceptLabel">"[S]ure&mdash;anything for the advancement of science."</String>
			<String id="DeclineLabel">"[N]o thanks."</String>
			<Text id="DeclineReply">
				The Teraton growls in disappointment. He turns away and continues
				his work on the human subjects.
			</Text>
			<Text id="SuccessMsg"></Text>
			<Text id="FailureMsg"></Text>
			<Text id="mutilation:start">
				The Teraton takes you to an empty bed and straps you down so that
				you cannot move. It then takes a scalpel and slices open both
				your forearms from the elbow to the wrist. You bleed profusely
				and mercifully pass out after a few minutes of screaming.
			</Text>
			<Text id="mutilation:success">
				You wake up in the nightmarish chamber and notice that both your
				arms are bandaged up.

				The Teraton attempts a smile and says, "Human! Your body is weak
				and easily killed. We have repaired as best as possible. For your
				pains we will reward you."
			</Text>
			<Text id="mutilation:plasma">
				You wake up in your ship with bloody bandages over both your arms.
				You open a case of artificial plasma and set up a transfusion.

				You start to feel better after an hour.
			</Text>
			<Text id="mutilation:autodoc">
				You wake up in your ship with bloody bandages over both your arms.
				You activate your portable autodoc and it drips a concoction of
				fluids and growth stims into your arm.

				You start to feel better immediately.
			</Text>
			<Text id="mutilation:death">
				Overnight your blood pressure drops as the bleeding continues.

				In the morning, the Teraton takes your lifeless body and dumps
				it into space.
			</Text>
			<Text id="filovirus:start">
				The Teraton takes you to an empty bed and straps you down so that
				you cannot move. It then takes a syringe and injects you with
				something. At first you feel OK, but after a few hours you ache
				all over and begin to vomit. After a couple of days you begin to
				bleed from every orifice and you mercifully fall into a coma.
			</Text>
			<Text id="filovirus:success">
				You wake up in the nightmarish chamber, a taste of vomit in your
				mouth, but otherwise OK.

				The Teraton attempts a smile and says, "Human! Your body is weak
				and easily killed. We have repaired as best as possible. For your
				pains we will reward you."
			</Text>
			<Text id="filovirus:cyanavir">
				You wake up in your ship covered in blood and vomit. You dose
				yourself with a course of cyanavir and try to sleep it off.

				After several days you recover enough to be able to eat again.
			</Text>
			<Text id="filovirus:autodoc">
				You wake up in your ship covered in blood and vomit. You activate
				your portable autodoc and it drips a concoction of antivirals into
				your arm.

				You start to feel better after a few days.
			</Text>
			<Text id="filovirus:death">
				Overnight you crash out as your organs liquefy from the viral load.

				In the morning, the Teraton carefully places your lifeless form
				into a body bag and dumps it into space.
			</Text>
			<Text id="mutagens:start">
				The Teraton takes you to an empty bed and straps you down so that
				you cannot move. It then opens up a large jar and carefully
				removes what looks like a cancerous growth. Slicing your chest
				with quick strokes, the Teraton implants the growth into your
				body. You pass out from the pain before it finishes.

			<Text id="mutagens:success">

			</Text>
			<Text id="mutagens:deathdrugs">
				You wake up in your ship covered in blood. You dose yourself with
				a course of cancer dust and try to sleep it off.

				After several days you recover enough to be able to eat again.
			</Text>
			<Text id="mutagens:autodoc">
				You wake up in your ship covered in blood. You activate your
				portable autodoc and it drips a concoction of oncokillers into
				your arm.

				You start to feel better after a few days.
			</Text>
			<Text id="mutagens:death">
				For days, the growth inside your chest gets bigger, feeding on
				your blood supply. After a month, the cancer metastasizes to your
				eyes and mouth.

				After two months, the Teraton dumps your lifeless body into space.
			</Text>
			<Text id="parasite:start">
				The Teraton takes you to an empty bed and straps you down so that
				you cannot move. It then opens up a small jar and carefully
				removes a translucent and gelatinous eel of some sort. Holding
				your head steady, it guides the eel into your nasal passage. The
				eel seems undisturbed by your piercing screams.
			</Text>
			<Text id="parasite:hypermycin">
				You wake up in your ship with a splitting headache and a nasty nose
				bleed. You dose yourself with a course of hypermycin and try to
				sleep it off.

				One morning you find a shriveled and desiccated eel by your pillow,
				and after that the headaches disappear.
			</Text>
			<Text id="parasite:autodoc">
				You wake up in your ship with a splitting headache and a nasty nose
				bleed. You activate your portable autodoc and it drips a concoction
				of antibiotics into your arm.

				One morning you find a shriveled and desiccated eel by your pillow,
				and after that the headaches disappear.
			</Text>
			<Text id="parasite:death">
				For days the eel grows inside your head, eating everything before
				it. Fortunately, the damage to your brain slips you into a deep
				catatonia and you feel nothing.

				After a month, the Teraton takes your lifeless body and dumps it
				into space.
			</Text>
			<Text id="msgReward">
				Once you've recovered, the Teraton comes to your ship, "Human! This
				payment compensates for your damage."

				It drops off %itemName% and leaves without another word.
