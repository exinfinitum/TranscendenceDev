				The station master greets you:

				"Welcome to the Heretic Archipelago! Are you a researcher? We get all kinds
				of scientists here&mdash;this is the Edge of Human Space, after all&mdash;so
				if you are a researcher, you've come to the right place, certainly!"

			<Text id="textSvalbard">

				"In fact, the Svalbard Explorer just arrived here all the way from St. Kats.
				They're studying the Iocrym and their confounded quarantine, but I think
				they might need some help."

			</Text>
			<Text id="textStations">

				"There are lots of scientific outposts here in the archipelago, but if you're
				looking to help, you could visit %stationName%, certainly. They're always
				asking for help!"

			<Text id="textControlPoint">

				"Matter of fact, I hear that some scientists even set up a base on an Iocrym
				station! Can you believe that? I'd like to know what the Iocrym think of
				that, certainly!"

				"'Course I don't really know what those scientists are up to. Come to think
				of it, I haven't seen any of them around here lately. I wonder if they poked
				their telescopes into something they weren't supposed to. I don't think the
				Iocrym like to be spied on, certainly! I don't think they like it at all!"

				"Well, I'm sure I've got their coordinates here somewhere..."

				"Here they are! I knew I had them! I'll program them into your ship's
