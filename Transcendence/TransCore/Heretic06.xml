				A Xenophobe fleet has found an Iocrym artifact. Your mission is to
				destroy the fleet and bring the artifact back to the Taikon research
				outpost.

				System: %systemName%\n
				Payment: None

			<Text id="Intro">

				A tall man in a corporate suit approaches you:

				"Welcome to TVX-1! Taikon Ventures is out here in the Heretic system
				studying Iocrym technology. If you're interested, we could use your
				help. All your discoveries will be placed in the public domain through
				our Free Knowledge Foundation&trade;."

			</Text>
			<Text id="Briefing">

				"There is an Iocrym artifact in the system that could help us to
				learn much more about their technology. Unfortunately, a Xenophobe
				fleet found it before we could study it and now they are refusing
				to share it."
				
				"The Xenophobes are a pest here in the Outer Realm&mdash;I don't
				think anyone will miss them if you destroy them and take the
				artifact back. Will you help us?"

			</Text>
			<Text id="AcceptReply">

				"Wonderful! We'll give you the coordinates of the fleet. There are
				quite a lot of them, but you should be able to handle them with
				your weapons. I'm pretty sure."

			</Text>
			<Text id="DeclineReply">

				"I understand. Killing a Xenophobe fleet is no small thing. But
				look at it this way: they would have no problem killing us. And
				ultimately, out here at the edge of Human Space, we're all alone.
				Think about it and come back when you change your mind."

			</Text>
			<String id="InProgress">
				"Have you found the Iocrym artifact yet?"
			</String>
			<Text id="SuccessDebrief">

				A group of Taikon scientists marvel over the Iocrym cybernetic tower.
				They immediately begin taking readings. The man in the corporate suit
				congratulates you:

				"Thank you for helping us&mdash;this is the first close look we've
				had at this kind of Iocrym technology. I have no doubt that it will
				help us. We've recorded our scans on to this ROM, take it to Kate
				Morgental aboard the Svalbard Explorer."

			</Text>
			<Text id="textSentinelAttack">

				As you turn to leave, the Iocrym cybernetic tower begins to emit a
				piercing high-pitched tone. Over the deafening screech you hear one
				of the scientists yell:

				"It's sending out a high-frequency signal of some sort! I think it's
				a communications signal aimed at the outer system. My guess is that
				the Iocrym now know that we've got it!"

			</Text>
			<Text id="FailureDebrief">

				The man in the corporate suit holds his head in his hands:

				"Without that cybernetic tower to study we've got nothing!
				How am I going to explain this to my VP?"

			</Text>

			<Text id="textBusy">

				A tall man in a corporate suit approaches you:

				"Welcome! When your current mission is complete, visit us again.
				We have a mutually beneficial proposition for you."
