				You bring the archcannon to the slave chamber. You hear a cacophony of voices
				rise up from the slave coffins. A laser lattice envelops the archcannon and the
				computer displays flash blueprints and diagnostics. Robot hands expertly repair
				the device.
				
				When the work is finished, the voices die away in a bittersweet tone of satisfaction.
